Engineering and engineers are very diverse. In ENGR 13100, you will begin to develop a wide variety of skills that will benefit you as a Purdue student and that you can build on as a practicing engineer. Topics covered include:

Develop code solutions that address engineering questions and follow professional programming standards. 
  
Understand and implement basic and intermediate programming structures: sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, and nested structures. 

Create adaptable, reusable programming routines.

Read and apply flowcharts as a visual representation of a process.

Analyze and model data using regression techniques.

Make appropriate predictions using a mathematical model. 

Apply design ideas to programming solutions.

Use evidence to evaluate, test, and optimize ideas and solutions

Communicate engineering concepts, ideas, and decisions effectively and professionally in diverse ways such as written, visual, and oral.

Contribute to team products and discussions. 

Design high quality technical solutions that meet client and user needs.
