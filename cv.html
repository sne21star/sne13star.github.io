Purdue University, VIP Researcher
Research team is VAA: Visual Analysis for Understanding Animal Behavior
Designed and developed a GUI for a research team that tracks turkey for poultry production
Abstract for my GUI was accepted to Purdue’s Undergraduate Research Conference.
Converted GUI to web application over the summer that is now interactive and intuitive that showcases 7 graphs which can interact with video data, 5 statistical graphs, an animation that tracers the turkey’s path, and a tab that showcase ML model used to track turkeys
Synopsis, Lima Perú, Automation Engineer
Conducted research to identify appropriate software to use and applied my research using Katalon Studio and Appium
Developed Automated Test scripts to Test Web and mobile Application for Synopsis’s client

Engineering Projects
Senior Design: EPCS 412:
Designed and developed a Real Time ASL translator application that uses Computer Vision to translate American Sign Language (ASL) for Senior Design. This project included the following:
Designed and developed an application that integrated Mediapipe and ASL translator model that can be used by students at the Indiana School of Deaf. Application integrates a static sign ASL translator tailored to the Indiana Sign Language.
Fined tuned an existing ML Model and integrated it with Google’s Mediapipe software framework to interpret the ASL Alphabet.
This application has nine different categories and also has a dynamic sign translator that can translate phrases in ASL alphabet.
Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras (CAM2):
Research team that revolves around using worldwide cameras and interpret data from the Cameras
Currently working on how to use the cameras to aid in the COVID-19 crisis by tracking those who wear masks or not.
Designed and developed web scraper that could parse different live cameras for information about the public and be used to decipher mask wearing.
ECE 57000 (Graduate Level AI Course): Fall 2020
Increased Accuracy of Text Recognition Model by modifying Text Rectification process.
Rewrote Thin Plate Spline Algorithm to straighten curved text found in natural settings before running Text Recognition Model
Increased accuracy of Text Recognition Model from 0.00% to 42.08%
Pulse Oximeter Project (ECE 362): Spring 2018
Designed a Pulse Oximeter using the MAX 30100 sensor and an STM 32 microcontroller
Responsible for creating Program that detected IR signals and converted them to the actually values for heartbeat and SP02 levels.
